\chapter*{Abstract}

In this project we will study the Deep Reinforcement Learning field in order to achieve an stable application for classic control problems. To do this we will investigate its fundamentals: Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks, learning which are their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we will merge both to progressivly improve our agent's performance and stability.

In order to gain a better insight we will personally implement the agents and algorithms. All of this will be tested through the popular framework OpenAI Gym.
