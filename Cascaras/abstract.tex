\chapter*{Abstract}

In this report we are going to show the knowledges that we have adquired along this year, from the previous research to get involve this project, until its practical conclussion, getting through all studied material to improve our results beyond the time.

We will start studying our project theorical bases, Machine Learning branches related with Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks. After that, we will combine both of them into the Deep Reinforcement Learning concept, which we will apply in different environments in order to build our final conclussions.
