\chapter*{Abstract}

In this report we will present the knowledges that we have adquired along this year, from the previous research to get involved this project, until its practical culmination, passing through all studied material in order to improve our results along the way.

We will start studying our project theorical bases, Machine Learning branches related with Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks. We will combine both of them into Deep Reinforcement Learning, which we will apply to different environments in order to build our final conclusions.

All of this project's related code can be found in the repository:
